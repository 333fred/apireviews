## Add feature and DiagnosticSource event for rejected request info

**Approved** | [#aspnetcore/34783](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/34783#issuecomment-891209558)

We drilled on the name, but think this is alright because the underlying feature also uses the term `BadHttpRequestException`, so we think keeping with the theme is fine.
