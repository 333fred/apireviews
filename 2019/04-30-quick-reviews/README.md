## add Netlink, Packet and Can to AddressFamily and ProtocolFamily enum

**Approved** | [#corefx/35143](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/35143#issuecomment-488053098) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQjHzmAomLE&t=0h47m46s)

We should rename `Can` to `ControllerAreaNetwork` to avoid confusion with it being a word in English. `Packet` seems generic, but we can't think of a better, so it's fine.
